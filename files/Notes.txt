GET and POST are two different types of HTTP requests. 
GET is used for viewing something, without changing it, while 
POST is used for changing something. 
For example, a search page should use GET to get data while 
a form that changes your password should use POST. 
Essentially GET is used to retrieve remote data, and POST is used to insert/update remote data.
